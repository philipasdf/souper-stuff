Angular Material
Firebase Authentication

History:
Removed this framework again, because it creates users collection by itself and you cannot customize user fields.
Also I only use google auth provider and don't get much from ngx-auth-firebaseui.
ngx-auth-firebaseui (ng Material, Firebase Auth, Angular Flex Layout)
https://www.npmjs.com/package/ngx-auth-firebaseui#vs
